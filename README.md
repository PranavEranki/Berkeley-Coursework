# Coursework I enjoyed while at UC Berkeley

## Focus: Systems, Security, Full-stack, Algorithms

<b> Each of the below links to a folder with materials pertaining to each class, complete with a README, homework/discussions/projects where applicable, and key takeaways from each class. </b>

I graduated after 2 hectic years full of late nights grinding out projects, early mornings preparing for midterms, and weekends spent making memories. I learned a lot about engineering, developed my technical skillset/portfolio, and most importantly, grew tenfold as a person and young adult. I tried to actively learn from my regrets, journal and introspect, and stay hungry for improvement. 

Although this won't be a huge blog post about everything I learned about myself as a person, and will mainly focus on my classes, _I gaurantee that college will teach you just as much, if not more, about your personality, deficiencies, strengths, traumas, and potential._

I hope this repository will serve useful for you. Best of luck in everything you do, and may you change the world.
Best,
Pranav

## [CS 61A](CS_61A)
- Intro to computer programming at a college level
- Concepts:
    - OOP, higher order functons / envs, lambda, functional abstraction
    - Recursion, trees and tree recursion, sequences (strs, lists, buffers), containers (dicts, etc)
    - Iterators / generators
    - Scheme (functional programming language, like Lisp)
- [CHEATSHEET](61a-final-study-guide.pdf)

## [CS 47B](CS_47B)
- Bridge course used to fufill my 61B requirement;
    - Focus on 
        - Intro to DS&A (linked lists, b-trees, BSTs, heaps, PQs, graphs, MSTs, sorting ) 
        - Advanced OOP concepts (polymorphism, asymptotics, ADTs, etc)
    - <b> Replicated the WWII [ENIGMA machine](CS_47B/proj1), which can be passed different configurations and messages to encode/decode </b>
    - <b> Created a basic version of Git, [GITLET](CS_47B/proj3), capable of efficient adds/commits/rm/checkouts/logs/status/branches/merges/resets</b>

## CS 70
- This class was very theoretically challenging and helped  develop mathematical maturity useful for EE / upper level CS classes.
- <b> Basics: </b> 
    - prop logic, proofs & weak/strong inducton, set theory, modular arithmetic
    - countability and computability, graph theory, polynomials
    - probability theory & conditional probability, random variables, variance/covariance, distributions (geometric/poisson/continuous), concentration inequalities
- <b> Higher level concepts: </b> 
    - RSA, error correcting codes, markov chains, coupon collector problem
- [Cheatsheet](CS70_Cheatsheet.pdf) 

## [CS 188](CS_188)
- This class introduces you to the basics of artificial intelligence. Across the key projects and homeworks, you learn many key concepts. The class uses a growingly complex implementation of Pacman to show you these concepts.
- Concepts: 
    - rational agents, state spaces & search trees
    - uninformed/informed search (DFS/BFS/UCS, A*, heuristics, local search)
        - [Project 1: Search](CS_188/search/)
    - games (trees, minimax & pruning, expectimax, monte carlo)
        - [Project 2: Multiagent Search](CS_188/multiagent/)
    - logic (prop logic, planning, inference, theorem proving, satisfiability, FOL)
        - [Project 3: Logic](CS_188/logic/)
    - probability (bayes nets, markov chains, hidden markov models + forward/viterbi, dyamic nets, decision networks, value of perfect information)
        - [Project 4: Tracking](CS_188/tracking)
    - Non-deterministic search (Markov decision processes, bellman, value/policy iteration, q-values)
    - ML (naive bayes, regression, perceptrons, reinforcement learning, Q-learning, exploration functions)
        - [Project 5: ML](CS_188/machinelearning)
        - [Project 6: RL](CS_188/reinforcement/)
