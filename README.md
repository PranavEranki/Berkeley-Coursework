## CS 161
- Easily one of my favorite classes at Berkeley, this class teaches memory safety, crytography, web security, and network security fundamentals for aspiring engineers. They maintain a beautiful [textbook](https://textbook.cs161.org/) which you should check out.
- Projects:
    - Proj 1: Exploiting a range of memory security vulnerabilities, see [our code here](CS_161/Proj1/) which has the different "flags" that we completed.
    - [Proj 2](CS_161/sp23-proj2-tahir-pranav-main/): Designed a secure file sharing system with user auth, save/load/overwrite/append/share/revoke access for all user files across sessions. Refer to [design doc](CS_161/sp23-proj2/Informal_Design_Doc.pdf) for more details, or see [our code here](S_161/sp23-proj2).
    - [Proj 3]: web safety attacks, including sql injection, session token and cookie manipulation, stored / reflected XSS attack, and sql vulnerability / hash decoders. Deliverables completed elsewhere, cannot share this.

## [CS 186](CS_186)
- This class covers database systems and their associated concepts, including SQL, disks and files, B+ trees, buffer management, relational algebra, hashing/sorting, iterators and joins. query optimiation, transactions and concurrency, design, recovery, parallel query processing, distributed transactions, NoSQL, and MapReduce/Spark. Their [notes](https://cs186berkeley.net/notes/) are also well maintained, refer to those.
- For our projects in this class, we:
    - wrote complex, nested SQL queries covering wide functionality
    - designed and tested B+ tree indices
    - wrote database iterators and implemented all efficient join algorithms, concurrently optimizing queries and conducting plan space search similar to System R
    - Implemented a concurrency locking system with queueing, adding multigranularity locking constraints and 2 phase locking, 
    - Wrote write-ahead logging and support for savepoints, rollbacks, and ACID compliant restart recovery
    - Wrote efficient, complex, pipelined NoSQL code for MongoDB.
- You can see my specific code for Projects 1-5 (the first five bullet points above) in [THIS FOLDER](CS_186).

## Eleng 122

    - A overview of how todayâ€™s Internet works and it's architecture
    - Key ideas behind Ethernet, WiFi networks, routing, internetworking, and TCP. 
    - Briefly covers probability, calculus, mathematical models, and markov chain concepts for background knowledge. 
    - LTE wireless networks, QoS, network protocols
    - Physical layer technologies
- For our final project in this class, my team and I developed a [Starlink LEO constellation network simulation](https://github.com/sidharthrajaram/starsim).

## [Comp Programming Decal](comp_decal)
- This decal run by Jelani Nelson and the Comp Programming Club @ Berkeley aims to introduce the basics of comp programming. I have attached <b>all lectures except the intro in the above folder </b>. These lectures were supplemented with Codeforces problems, some of which are mentioned by name in the lectures.

## Cogsci 131
- This class had a very interesting, informative lecture on computational models of cognition, but most of the material from this class was simple data analysis type stuff, building neural networks, etc.
    - covering the logic behind neural networks
    - providing insight how humans solve challenging computational problems
    - exploring three ways in which researchers have attempted to formalize cognition -- symbolic approaches, neural networks, and probability and statistics -- considering the strengths and weaknesses of each.

## CS 162 Lectures
- I watched this [free lecture series on operating systems and systems programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF2K2xZjNEf97A_uBCwEl61sdxWVP7VWC) on and off just to get a better understanding. A lot of the material overlaps with CS 186 and Eleng 122, which is why I found it very helpful
