# Coursework I enjoyed while at UC Berkeley

## Focus: Systems, Security, Full-stack, Algorithms

<b> Each of the below links to a folder with materials pertaining to each class, complete with a README, homework/discussions/projects where applicable, and key takeaways from each class. </b>

I graduated after 2 hectic years full of late nights grinding out projects, early mornings preparing for midterms, and weekends spent making memories. I learned a lot about engineering, developed my technical skillset/portfolio, and most importantly, grew tenfold as a person and young adult. I tried to actively learn from my regrets, journal and introspect, and stay hungry for improvement. 

Although this won't be a huge blurb about everything I learned about myself as a person, and will mainly focus on my classes, _I gaurantee that college will teach you just as much, if not more, about your personality, deficiencies, strengths, traumas, and potential._

I hope this repository will serve useful for you. Best of luck in everything you do, and may you change the world for the better.
Best,
Pranav
